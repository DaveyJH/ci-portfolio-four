## LO1 Use an Agile methodology to plan and design a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC framework and related contemporary technologies

- [ ] 1.1 Design a Front-End for a data-driven web application that meets
  accessibility guidelines, follows the principles of UX design, meets its given
  purpose and provides a set of user interactions.
- [ ] 1.2 Implement custom HTML and CSS code to create a responsive Full-Stack
  application consisting of one or more HTML pages with relevant responses to
  user actions and a set of data manipulation functions
- [ ] 1.3 Build a database-backed MVC web application that allows users to store
  and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
- [ ] 1.4 Design a database structure relevant for your domain, consisting of a
  minimum of one custom model.
- [ ] 1.5 Use an Agile tool to manage the planning and implementation of all
  significant functionality
- [ ] 1.6 Document and implement all User Stories and map them to the project
  within an Agile tool
- [ ] 1.7 Write Python code that is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8
  style guide and validated HTML and CSS code.
- [ ] 1.8 Include sufficient custom Python logic to demonstrate your proficiency
  in the language
- [ ] 1.9 Include functions with compound statements such as if conditions
  and/or loops in your Python code
- [ ] 1.10 Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments,
  indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions).
- [ ] 1.11 Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or
  capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
- [ ] 1.12 Document and implement all User Stories within the Agile tool and map
  them to the project goals
- [ ] 1.13 Document the UX design work undertaken for this project, including
  any wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc.,created as part of the design process
  and its reasoning. Include diagrams created as part of the design process and
  demonstrate that these have been followed through to implementation

## LO2 Implement a data model, application features and business logic to manage, query and manipulate data to meet given needs in a particular real-world domain.

- [x] 2.1 Develop the model into a usable database where data is stored in a
  consistent and well-organised manner.
- [x] 2.2 Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and
  delete records
- [x] 2.3	All changes to the data should be notified to relevant user
- [x] 2.4 Implement at least one form, with validation, that allows users to
  create and edit models in the backend

## LO3 Identify and apply authorisation, authentication and permission features in a Full-Stack web application solution

- [x] 3.1	Apply role-based login and registration functionality
- [x] 3.2	The current login state is reflected to the user
- [ ] 3.3 Users should not be permitted to access restricted content or
  functionality prior to role-based login.

## LO4 Create manual and/or automated tests for a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC framework and related contemporary technologies

- [ ] 4.1 Design and implement manual and/or automated Python test procedures to
  assess functionality, usability, responsiveness and data management within the
  entire web application
- [ ] 4.2 Design and implement manual and/or automated JavaScript test
  procedures to assess functionality, usability, responsiveness and data
  management within the entire web application
- [ ] 4.3	Document all implemented testing in the README.

## LO5 Use a distributed version control system and a repository hosting service to document, develop and maintain a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC framework and related contemporary technologies

- [x] 5.1 Use Git & GitHub for version control of a Full-Stack web application
  up to deployment, using commit messages to document the development process.
- [x] 5.2 Commit final code that is free of any passwords or security-sensitive
  information to the repository and the hosting platform

## LO6 Deploy a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC framework and related contemporary technologies to a cloud-based platform

- [x] 6.1 Deploy a final version of the Full-Stack application code to a
  cloud-based hosting platform and test to ensure it matches the development
  version
- [ ] 6.2 Ensure that the final deployed code is free of commented out code and
  has no broken internal links
- [ ] 6.3	Document the deployment process in a README file in English
- [x] 6.4 Ensure the security of the deployed version, making sure to not
  include any passwords in the git repository, that all secret keys are hidden
  in environment variables or in files that are in .gitignore, and that DEBUG
  mode is turned off

## LO7 Understand and use object-based software concepts

- [x] 7.1 Design a custom data model that fits the purpose of the project
